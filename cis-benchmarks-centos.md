# Doing CIS benchmakrs right



In this article we will focus on -
* Prioritizing benchmarks according to your security policies
* Relating CIS controls with MITRE ATTACK Framework

CIS Benchmarks guidelines for various technology groups to safeguard systems against todayâ€™s evolving cyber threats. While it is important that you harden your systems to improve security posture, many compliance programs require system hardening as a mandatory control. 
The PCI DSS requirement 2.2.c states
> Examine policies and interview personnel to verify that system configuration standards are applied when new systems are configured and verified as being in place before a system is installed on the network.

In the evolving tech industry, we're seeing more and more distributed team being formed for handling specific functions. System hardening naturally falls under the 'Security' umbrella. In large organizations, it would be quite daunting to justify need for making system configuration changes to thousands of server roles because a list (like CIS benchmarks) tells you to. It is very important that security team does not overload the infrastructure teams with a long list of unjustified changes.
